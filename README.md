LSS (Laravel Solid Server) is a [Solid server](https://solidproject.org) built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

Currently, it's just a proof of concept and doesn't support most of the hairy stuff (ACLs, content negotiation, etc.). But the basic CRUD operations and authentication is implemented, and it already works with a couple of apps like [Ramen](https://ramen.noeldemartin.com) and [Focus](https://focus.noeldemartin.com).

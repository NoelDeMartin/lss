# LSS ![CI](https://github.com/noeldemartin/lss/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

LSS (Laravel Solid Server) is a [Solid server](https://solidproject.org) built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

Currently, it's just a proof of concept and doesn't even support authentication or authorization. But the basic CRUD operations are implemented, and it already works with a couple of apps ignoring the authentication logic (See the `lss` branches in [Ramen](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/ramen/tree/lss) and [Solid Focus](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/tree/lss)).
